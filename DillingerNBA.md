The NBA was formed on August 3, 1949 after a merging of two organizations and has remained on the move. The league has  been  constantly evolving with new developments ranging from the creation of the 24-second shot clock (History.com, 2009) to breakaway rims fit for Shaquille O’Neil . The NBA is working towards a future of basketball-related technology such as the collection of player data using wearable devices, biometrics, and analytical software such as SportVU. In recent years, the NBA has been progressing technologically by taking an interest into crunching data through the use of analytical software which collects data using these developing inventions and software. The use of these tools have given franchises a new perspective on player statistics and opportunities to devise new game strategies thanks to the work of Data Scientists. 

The holy grail of any NBA franchise is to win a Championship. After that, it’s two peat and then three peat and so on.  Some teams never win one but the few who do, understand what it takes to achieve glory. The requirements consist of many things but to name a few, a championship team needs a strong staff backing the team, strong players with drive and talent, training staff and injury management, and coaching to list a few. In the modern age, now it’s data. We’ve established that championships will do whatever it takes to win a ring. In doing so, the NBA teams have formed teams of data scientists to collect and analyze data on their players, plays, and games. This data is striking as The Economist (2018)  reported that, “Which shots provided the best bang for buck? Two point dunks and three pointers shot from outside the three point line rather than long range two point shots from inside it.”  Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, doubled down and claimed that, “It’s pretty dramatic how powerful the three point shot is - you only have to make a third of your three pointer shots to be worth half of your two.” Since then, the yearly percentile of attempted three point shots in the NBA  has been increasing steadily. 

Wearable technology is one facet NBA Data Scientists are utilizing to harvest player data and minimize player injury. Championships have been lost to player injury so this is an asset the NBA looks towards by developing force plates to measure muscle imbalances. Back in 1989, then Lakers head coach Pat Riley held a weekend conditioning camp for the team right before their upcoming Championships game. Magic Johnson suffered through a game and series-ending hamstring injury shortly after. There is still speculation on whether or not that training camp was too much conditioning before the game for Magic. The development of these force plates is designed to avoid these questions by understanding the player’s body limits without regard to their mental drive. Players like Kobe Bryant have been known to push the limit and play with a broken finger so it can be wise to reference the numbers. To take force plates a step further, companies such as Nextile  are developing these into more flexible designs that are more accessible such as sewn in fabrics with the plates to gather data. Dowsett (2022) reports on the utility of Nextile’s fabrics as:

Nextiles has utilized their tech in both shooting sleeves and performance socks, the latter of which can track virtually everything the portable force plate can plus even more data, such as:  Specific force impacts on distinct foot areas, Gait analysis, Ankle angle and roll analysis, Feet orientation, position and angle — both on the ground and during jumps, Cut angle , Step count, walk-run cadence and other simple metrics. This is ground breaking. The Lakers would have loved this intel in 89’ before they lost Magic and a ring. The NBA has been learning from their past mistakes and implemented additional health and safety measures during the eruption of the COVID-19 pandemic through wearable tech that monitored player biometric health. The Oura ring was an optional gear for players to wear to protect against illness. The ring is able to monitor bodily temperature, oxygen rates, and heart rate to name a few. Eadicicco from Business Insider reports that, “ One way Oura does this is by calculating a risk score. This assesses four metrics: changes in temperature, changes in respiratory rate, changes in heart rate, and heart rate variability versus a user's baseline (2020).”

 Wearable technology needs some help in the software market to be able to put in some work and crunch numbers. Software has been developed to assist in this aspect by gathering data through player movements in each game. Player movements can not only be recorded through wearable tech but also visually through game  recordings. Stadiums are being redesigned in a way to accommodate this tech so Data Scientists can harvest this player data. Stadiums are being designed with a precise layout in order to allow strategic positioning of motion cameras to capture movements from multiple angles.  Rajiv Maheswaran, who  is the President of Second Spectrum, develops technology catered towards sports software for coaches and teams to use in analytics. Maheswaran specifically developed a software that focuses on documenting each unique movement on the court at a fraction of a second per player.. NBA games have four quarters that are each twelve minutes long which can easily equate to thousands of player movement clips that would be impossible to  analyze or interpret by hand making it  necessary to formulate  a method to clean and organize this data for interpretation  by the teams. Maheswaran discusses in a Ted Talk (2015)  about running all of this raw data and interpreting it into useful analytics for basketball coaches through the use of machine learning technology by discussing:
	
The problem is a machine can't see things with the eye of a coach. Until now. We started simply by teaching it things like passes and shots  or rebounds. We then moved on to more slightly complicated events like post ups, and pick and rolls and isolations. We have gotten to a point where the machines know complex events like down screens and wide pins, basically things only professional players know. 
Through the use of machine learning and dots on a screen (the players), the software is able to learn how to differentiate these specific plays from each other by being shown movements that are similar to a play between players in a recorded game. The machine is given movements that would show a rebound and then shown movements that do not constitute a rebound so it can be encouraged to determine a difference by finding unique features that help it separate the player movements. Maheswaran coins this process spatiotemporal pattern recognition. In basketball there are certain plays that are performed under precise conditions or scenarios in which this software is able to analyze and detect the precise movement that yielded a play. This is amazing for teams and coaches because they can take this information and learn which players tend to deviate to certain plays  and formulate strategies against opponents. Part of the game is mental and certain players have learned to strategize against opposing players by playing to their weaknesses. The ability to have hard statistics on a player who consistently pulls rebounds after a certain play provides the team an opportunity to incorporate this fact when opposing that player. This provides a new facet to professional hoops where technology can bring an edge to coaches and their teams. This also benefits the team themselves since they can use this feedback to build on their weaknesses and have a more refined approach towards making decisions on which players to play. Ideally players should be well rounded and to make moves on the fly since one can not typically predict a game, or can they? The possibilities are endless since NBA franchises will have access to this hard data and utilize it during draft picks and the regular season for decisions. Statistics are absolutely referenced during the NBA draft and player trades. The rise of these technological advancements offers  more opportunity to discriminate against a player who’s statistics may not compliment others on their team in more precise, technical probabilities that are unprecedented. There may also be an overlap with companies who are in partnership with  competing franchises who also utilize the same sports software which are managed by this  same company. This could translate to insider knowledge on team strategies and plays in addition to individual player data that should be kept confidential. 

Sports vision analysis can be applied to multiple movement based sports, non-inclusive to basketball. This software can be used in a more general approach for each unique sport by tracking players or ball movement trajectories and then organizing it into visuals, animations, or compiled data sets. There are quite a few challenges in being able to detect players or additional key features as there may be an overlap in pixel colors by the ground the game is on, the color of a players uniform, or lighting casting shadows during a recording. Detection tracking is vital in gathering correct data but this may bring forth some issues when sorting through pixels of different colors. During the Covid pandemic, essentially all schools and businesses were forced to move online. Zoom was at the frontlines in spearheading this, in addition to similar online proctoring software to facilitate test taking. Students with darker skin complexions have had issues with these proctoring software as it wasn’t optimized for a spectrum of skin complexions and would falsely flag students. Detection tracking in sports software analyzes multiple variables, such as the color of pixels, to keep track of and distinguish accurately for data mining.  As a result, there must be a method to properly distinguish player skin tones, uniforms, and lighting on the court to properly pick up on accurate motions and movements. Naik (2022)  describes the functionality of sports vision developments by stating, “An application that uses AI contains a huge dataset of game performances and training-related information, which is backed up with the knowledge of several coaches and sports scientists. They act as an accumulated source of current knowledge on the dissemination of the latest techniques, tactics, or knowledge for professional coaches.” Sports vision developments are not only  ingrained into the modern era NBA, but other major sporting leagues for its invaluable numerical  insight. In a way, franchises are required to  have their own Data Science teams if they want to keep up with the big dogs and get a ring. 
	
The NBA began as an organization that consisted of two distinct basketball associations that merged together back in 49’. Through this partnership, the league was able to go around the country and form respective teams individually  in major cities. As the years rolled by, new concepts arose to speed up the game and naturally new ideas were made to bring more attention to the franchises and increase fan attendance. The modern era NBA is more competitive than ever through the use of wearable tech, sports software, and player biometrics.  The player data gathered by these tools offer insider knowledge on optimal team plays and draft picks, which can only be achieved by embracing the data technology train or being left in the dust like the Lakers current 2022 - 23 season. It is essential for the heaps of player data to be analyzed and strategized over in optimal processes to benefit respective franchises. There may be a sway in certain player decisions which are based upon the statistics yielded from sports vision software, player biometrics, and wearable tech as it ideally provides a factual, unbiased outlook on player statistics. Ideally this is only based on data that is gathered without discrimination on the players or influenced by other agents of inaccuracy during interpretation of the data. Ultimately the NBA will become more involved in the tech world and will have to define boundaries to ensure their progression of technology isn’t being led astray, as they keep progressing throughout the years and utilizing increasingly advanced tech to formulate franchises' decisions.
